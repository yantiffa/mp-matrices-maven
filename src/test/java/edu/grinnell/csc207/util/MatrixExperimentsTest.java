/**
 * Automated tests based on {@link edu.grinnell.csc207.experiments.MatrixExperiments}.
 *
 * <p>This test suite was created by implementing stubs in {@link MatrixV0},
 * executing {@code MatrixExperiments} (written by SamR), and directly using
 * the console output to form assertions.</p>
 *
 * <p>In my coding environment, I used a paid GitHub Copilot subscription,
 * which provided auto-suggestions for some of the stub methods in {@link MatrixV0}.
 * After review, I incorporated some of these suggestions. Note: {@link MatrixV0}
 * is not included here, as it is part of an active assignment for SamRâ€™s
 * CSC207 course, Fall 2024.</p>
 * 
 * <p>After writing this test suite, I asked ChatGPT-o1-preview (the "advanced
 * reasoning skills" model) to double-check my work. The prompt I used was
 * "<COPY-PASTED CODE HERE> Can you double check that this all makes sense?
 * Have I made any mistakes? Be extra thorough.". ChatGPT's response indiciated
 * thoroughness (it didn't skip or hallucinate anything), and it's conclusion
 * was "[...] I did not find any mistakes in your code. [...]"</p>
